Learning Paths from Feedback Using Q-Learning and SARSA

I implemented Q learning and SARSA using Java and JFrame on NetBeans IDE.
JFrame was used for visualization of moving the agent. 


HOW TO RUN:

Click "RL.bat" to run the program or compile .java files with javac 
or use Netbeans to open the folder "RL" and run it.

 
Choose a reinforcement learning method: 1.Qlearning 2.SARSA.

Choose a policy: 1.PRANDOM 2.PEXPLOIT 3.PGREEDY.

Input a number for max moves to terminate: 1000 - 30000.

Choose a moving speed for the agent: 1.very fast 2.normal 3.slow
